-I was wondering if it was possible to install Bootstrap to create the Accordion, Carousel and Cards ?
## -> So I'll code everything without using any librarie because it wasn't mentioned in the test descreption.

THe test is a landing page I split it with make every section in a componant as well in scss.

-SCSS: code I'll used VS code extention compiler to compile it to css.
-icons: I used the delivred icons in figma file.

for the responsivity with all devices I worked with scss mixing and I worked on the principle of product being responsive depending on what I see.
-the product 

# 1- I created the skeltton of the page with its styling 
# 2- I make it responsive
# 3- I add some functions like submit form & scrolling
# 4- deploying on Netlify
# 4- Adding TS by installing :typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest.
